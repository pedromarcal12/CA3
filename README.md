In this CA we were requested to create a webpage with the following settings:
Staff password validator: create a password validator, which tests whether or not the staff’s desired password is strong enough.
User generation: you are required to create at least 5 randomly generated user profiles for the customers using JSON data returned from the random user API.
Food cost: the application should include a form that will allow the waiter to choose from a range of available menu items. The menu should include starters, main, dessert and drinks. There should be a minimum of 3 items in each category (i.e. 3 starters, 3 mains, etc.). Some of the guests may be vegetarian, so the starters and mains should contain at least 1 vegetarian menu item. Each menu item is an object containing: the dish name, a short (1 line) description, a suitable variable that indicates whether the dish is vegetarian, and the cost of the dish. A breakdown of the bill will be returned to the user showing:
the overall bill 
a summary of each of the costs subdivided by starters, main, dessert and drinks.
a comparison of the cost of the vegetarian meals ordered vs the cost of the non-vegetarian meals–this only needs to be calculated on the starters and mains. 
And a second page, which we were free to chose the contents
